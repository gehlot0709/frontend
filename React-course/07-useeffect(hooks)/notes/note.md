**The useEffect hook in React is used to handle side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up event listeners. Before hooks, these tasks were managed using lifecycle methods in class components.**

Key Features of useEffect

- Runs after the component renders.
- Can be controlled using a dependency array to specify when it should execute.
- Can include a cleanup function to remove event listeners or cancel API requests when the component unmounts.
